Data Modeling App

I have tried to create a Data modeling app to simplify, analyze, and visualize datasets for companies . The app aims to make working with financial data easier, more efficient, and less time-consuming by providing tools for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Upload financial data files (CSV format).
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean data to remove inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and trend detection on the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data through various charts and tables.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports based on the analysis.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI, Recharts
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Python (for data processing)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas library in Python
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
- **Git**: Download and install from [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/shauryaaryan/FinancialModeling.git
   cd FinancialModeling








# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

To ensure that your backend server is running, you can follow these steps:

 Check the Server Status in Terminal
Run the backend server in your terminal and ensure there are no errors:

Navigate to the Backend Directory
cd ~/WebstormProjects/financialmodeling/backend
Start the Server:
node server.js
You should see output similar to:
Server running on http://localhost:5000

2. Verify the Server is Running in a Browser

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You should see a response indicating the server is running.

For example, if you configured your root route to return a simple HTML message, you should see:
<h1>Backend Server is Running</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Financial Modeling API</p>

3. Test API Endpoints

You can use a tool like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints.



Just Upload Endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload -F 'file=@path/to/your/file.csv'
Clean Endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/clean -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filePath":"/uploads/your_uploaded_file.csv"}'
Analyze Endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/analyze -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filePath":"/uploads/your_uploaded_file.csv"}'
Report Endpoint:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/report -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"filePath":"/uploads/your_uploaded_file.csv"}'
Replace path/to/your/file.csv and /uploads/your_uploaded_file.csv with actual paths.

4. Check Logs for Errors

To ensure there are no errors in the terminal where you started the server. If you see errors, troubleshoot them based on the error messages.
By following these steps, the backend server should be running correctly. If you encounter any issues, please reach out to me.
